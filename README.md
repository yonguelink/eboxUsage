# EBox Internet Usage

This tool (in PhantomJS) allows you to automatically fetch your internet usage over EBox's client website.

Simply rename the `config.json.example` to `config.js` and configure it with your client code and client password, run `phantomjs <path/to/eboxUsage.js>` and check the file `data.txt` for the result.

I use it in Rainmeter as a simple way to know if I'm busting my limit.
